As a developer
I will develop a movies database utilizing my improved knowledge of PHP, JS, CSS and MySQL. 
This project will perform basic operations like create, list, update and delete functionality
the site needs a login interface for users to access the site                                                                                             
Developer creates a login page containing the 'email' and 'password' fields.
once logged in, he is redirected to login page
his name is displayed in the header alongside the sign out button which logs him out  
The Movies Database now needs members to come and register on site. 
Create a signup page for users to come to site and register for free. 
The signup form should have following fields:
First name: [ textbox ]
Last name: [ textbox ]
Gender: [ radio buttons ]
Year of birth: [ textbox ]
